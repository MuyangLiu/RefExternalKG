# Breadth First Search (BFS): 

For every vertex v, breadth-first search (BFS) determines
the minimum number of hops required to reach v from a given
source vertex.

BFS requires a parameter to assign the source. Its value can be set by the flag: `--bfs_source`.

This directory includes two variants of BFS.
