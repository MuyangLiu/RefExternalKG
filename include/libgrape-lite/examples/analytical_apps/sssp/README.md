# Single-Source Shortest Path

Single-source shortest paths (SSSP) computes the length of the shortest paths from a given source vertex to
all other vertices in graphs. SSSP requires a weight(distance) on each edge in the input graph. The result comes with double-precision floating point weights.

SSSP requires a parameter to assign the source. Its value can be set by the flag: `--sssp_source`.

This directory includes 3 variants of SSSP.
