# Weakly Connected Component

In graph theory, a component, sometimes called a connected component, of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)) 

Algorithm weakly connected components (WCC) determines the weakly connected component each vertex belongs to. 

This directory includes 3 variants of WCC.
