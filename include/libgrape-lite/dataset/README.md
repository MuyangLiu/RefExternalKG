About the dataset
-----------------

The file `p2p-Gnutella31.e` refers to the _"Gnutella peer-to-peer network, August 31 2002"_ from the
[SNAP][1] project, which can be obtained from [http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella31.html][2].

The files `p2p-31.e` and `p2p-31.v` are derived based on the `p2p-Gnutella31.e`,
with edge data and vertex data added.

Other files are results of our built-in graph analytical algorithms, as follows:

+ p2p-31-BFS: the result of the breadth-first search(BFS) algorithm
+ p2p-31-CDLP: the result of the community detection of label propagation(CDLP) algorithm
+ p2p-31-LCC: the result of the local clustering coefficient(LCC) algorithm
+ p2p-31-PR: the result of the PageRank algorithm
+ p2p-31-SSSP: the result of the single-source shortest path(SSSP) algorithm
+ p2p-31-WCC: the result of the weakly connected component(WCC) algorithm
